for d in folder:
    list all mp3 files

    create an emptry list() (shall be emptied for each folder!)

    try to read selected tags from files -> each selected tag is saved into a dictionary, which is appended to the "folder list".

    create a helper with the number of files in that folder. (for number of leading zeros for track number) (track number shall 03 or 003 (if there are more than 100 entries in that folder) (check for mix folders like my collected hip hop folder).
    create a helper that shows whether there are multiple cd's in the same folder (change in name of album and distinct entries in cd nummer tag).

    for i in len("folder list"):
        improve all tags (so, loop through each key in i and correct accordingly). (For cd number based on value of above created helper) (for zeros to fill in front of track numbers )
